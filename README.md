# TweetSentimentAnalyzer
This project is a Twitter (X) Sentiment Analyzer that scrapes real-time tweets based on a given search query, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the results. Using Selenium, the script dynamically fetches tweets, processes them using a custom sentiment analysis algorithm, and categorizes them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
